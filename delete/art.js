In Meadow of the Deer, this family of oversized steel silhouettes casually roam the grounds, paying homage to the park’s historic natural elegance while highlighting its history of healing. Derived from Old English, the word Raleigh loosely translates to mean “meadow of the deer.” Quite fittingly, the stoic profile of a stag wanders the City’s oldest double-sided flag.     Inspired by the archived drawings of the former mental health hospital’s patients, which often focused on radial and repetitive gestures as a means of calming the mind, Meadow of the Deer’s radiating sculptural linework consists of layers of steel radiating in an x-formation from the center outward. This stratified approach allows for a unique level of transparency and environmental integration.

The poem is presented in two parts and through fabrication it is rooted deeper in the park still. Displayed on the House of Many Porches, the entire piece is engraved on pecan wood slabs reclaimed from trees felled at Dix Park.
